# LegionellaSerogroup1Genome
A repository to accompany our manuscript on different characteristics of the *Legionella longbeachae* serogroup 1 genome.

This repository contains the following files and scripts:
* `LegionellaCircos.pl`
* `file B`


## Requirements to run these scripts 

The following software is required to run these scripts.

* Perl -- a relatively recent version of Perl, 5.20 and above.  Packages required are `Getopt::Long`, `Bio::SeqIO`, `Bio::Seq` and `DBI` (for connections to MySQL).
